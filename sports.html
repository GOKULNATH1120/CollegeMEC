        <p class="microsoft-paragraph">Sport is an activity that Mailam Engineering College is often engaged in competitively and is governed by a set of rules or customs in our Physical Education Department. Used by itself, sports commonly refer to activity where the physical capabilities of our Mailam Engineering College players are the sole or primary determiner of the outcome – the winning or losing, but the term is also used to include activities such as mind sports and motors where mental acuity or equipment quality are the major factors. All sports of our college have a winning player or team and a losing player or team. If there is no loser or winner its not a sport.<br><br>The Management gave us to which Physical Education Department put center around physical health and character building. The vast recourses laid on for physical education in our college and city league programs are justified by appeal to the presumed increases features of modern sport activity which be speak this rationale.</p>
